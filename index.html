            God of War[a] is an action-adventure game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE). Released on 
            April 20, 2018, for the PlayStation 4 (PS4), it is the eighth installment in the God of War series, and the sequel 
            to 2010's God of War III. Unlike previous games, which were loosely based on Greek mythology, this installment is
             rooted in Norse mythology, with the majority of it set in ancient Norway in the realm of Midgard. For the first 
             time in the series, there are two protagonists: Kratos, the former Greek God of War who remains the only playable character, 
             and his young son Atreus. Following the death of Kratos' second wife and Atreus' mother, they journey to fulfill her request 
             that her ashes be spread at the highest peak of the nine realms. Kratos keeps his troubled past a secret from Atreus, 
             who is unaware of his divine nature. Along their journey, they encounter monsters and gods of the Norse world.

            Gears of War 3 is a third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Studios for 
            the Xbox 360. It is the third installment of the Gears of War series.[1] Originally due for release on April 8, 2011,
             the game was delayed and eventually released on September 20, 2011.[2] The story was written by science fiction author 
             Karen Traviss.[3]

            Like its predecessors, Gears of War 3 received widespread critical acclaim from critics. Critics praised its story, 
            voice acting, visuals, and music, but criticized its lack of innovation. Gears of War 3 sold over 3 million copies and 
            was the second best selling game in the U.S.
            
            A sequel, not developed by Epic Games titled Gears of War 4, was announced in June 2015 and was released on October 11,
             2016.
             Like its predecessors, Gears of War 3 is a third-person shooter that emphasizes the use of cover and squad tactics
              in order to survive combat situations. The player's character can carry four weapons: one pistol, one set of grenades, 
              and two primary weapons. Firearms can be swapped with other weapons dropped by fallen foes or at stockpiles throughout the 
              game, along with ammunition. When the player reloads a weapons ammunition, they have an opportunity for an "active reload", 
              shown by a small cursor moving over a line with a marked section on the player's heads-up display (HUD). If the player hits
               a control button when the cursor is in the marked section, they will reload faster with the resulting reload being slightly
               more powerful than normal bullets, causing more damage to opponents as well as allowing for more "knockback" meaning that 
               enemies running directly at you will be slowed on shot. If they press the button outside this section, this temporarily jams
                the weapon, leaving the player vulnerable and taking longer to reload. Alternatively, the player can opt to not try for the 
                active reload, reloading the weapon at normal speed, but with no added damage.
